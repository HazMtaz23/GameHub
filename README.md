## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser** or use a local server
3. **Start adding your games** in the `games/` directory

### Using a Local Server (Recommended)

For the best development experience, use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
npx http-server

# Using VS Code Live Server extension
# Right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Adding New Games

To add a new game to your GameHub:

1. **Create a new directory** in the `games/` folder for your game
2. **Add your game files** (HTML, CSS, JS, assets)
3. **Update the home screen** by modifying the game cards in `index.html`
4. **Use the GameHub.addGame() function** in JavaScript for dynamic game addition

### Example Game Card

```javascript
GameHub.addGame({
    title: "My New Game",
    description: "An exciting new game to play",
    icon: "ðŸŽ®",
    gradientColors: "from-blue-500 to-purple-600",
    hoverGradient: "from-purple-500 to-blue-600",
